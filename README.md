Built a prediction algorithm to provide a review of Apple products based on tweets about the product.
Performed data cleaning using regex and stemming. Extracted the features of the tweets using Text-Blob and polarity.
Visualized the extracted feature using a sea-born count plot, performed vectorization and fed the data to the machine learning models.
Compared the performance of various machine learning models using a confusion matrix and classification report. Improved the accuracy of the model using Hyper Parameter Tuning
Created a front-end graphical user interface using Tkinter, where the users can input the required tweet in the text box and click the Analyze button. The prediction by the ML model is displayed as output.
